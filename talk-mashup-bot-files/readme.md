# ALA talk titles

These **1,463** talk titles are a selection of the full schedules of the ALA Annual Meeting 2016-2021. 

## What's not included
Board meetings, committee round tables, sponsored sessions, and other talks aren't included in the full talk list in this repo. Author names aren't included, to avoid out-of-context tweets that mention real people by name. Additionally, some serious-sounding talk titles aren't included â€” not out of censorship, but in order to avoid unfortunate mash-ups that fall in "yikes" territory or generally not in the spirit of this whimsical bot.

## Splitting talk names
The "beginners" and "enders" files are made by using **splitter.py** on the full talk list, and splitting talk titles on the words *at*, *of*, *for*, *on*, *and*, and colons and question marks.
